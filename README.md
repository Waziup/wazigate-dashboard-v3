Development
===========

You can develop on the dashboard locally on your PC, linking it to a remote WaziGate.
Run it like this:
```
export VITE_WAZIGATE_API_URL=http://wazigate-dashboard.staging.waziup.io
npm run dev
```

Then, you need to open the interface inyou browser, without CORS protections.
With Chrome, you can run it like that:
```
google-chrome --disable-site-isolation-trials --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="~/tmp"
```
Or install a plugin to remove CORS protections.
